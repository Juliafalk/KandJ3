# KandJ3

## Background

This iOS application has been developed between March and May 2018 by three engineering students at Uppsala University during the course *Independent Project in Sociotechnical Systems Engineering - IT Systems*. The three students formed team J3 and the process resulted in runRouter, an application which gives the user the possibility of creating a route with a wanted distance. runRouter will save information about the routes along with information about the user's run and give the user the option to run that specific route again in the future. runRouter is based on inspiration from other exercise application, but offers an extension of functionality with its ability to let the user specify the wanted distance beforehand, instead of only measuring it during the user's run.

## Development tools

*The application is developed with the help of following tools and software*

- ReactJS
- React Native
- Redux
- Firebase
- Google Maps API
- NativeBase.io

## System overview

## How to start the simulation: 

Firstly, it is only possible to simulate the application on a MacOS computer. This cause Xcode is required for simulation. Xcode is a software developed by Apple and works both as code editor and as a way for simulating for a certain iOS device. 

If you have a MacOS computer, the first step is to install Xcode, which is founded in AppStore. This take around 30 minutes, so please be patience. 

Also, to be able to simulate the application it requires that you have a software that makes it possible to run npm install, for example [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Thereafter, navigate to the map/file/place where you want the project to be stored . When these step is done, the project can be clone or downloaded. Run the following commands in the terminal window. 

1. *Clone the project*

  ```git clone https://github.com/Juliafalk/KandJ3.git```

2. *Install the necessary package/extensions/APIs for the project. Make sure that you are in the correct folder i.e. the KandJ3 folder*.

  ```npm install```

3. *Start the simulations. Make sure that you are in the correct folder i.e. the KandJ3 folder*

  ```react-native run-ios```

Then, wait a couple of minutes for the simulator to starts, first time it can take around five minutes. 

When the simulator has started correctly, all is done and you are ready to explore the application, hope you enjoy it as much as we do!
