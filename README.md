# KandJ3

How to start the simulation: 
Firstly, it is only possible to simulate the application on a MacOS computer. This cause Xcode is required for simulation. Xcode is a software developed by Apple and works both as code editor and as a way for simulating for a certain iOS device. 

If you have a MacOS computer, the first step is to install Xcode, which is founded in AppStore. This take around 30 minutes, so please be patience. 

Also, to be able to simulate the application it requires that you have a software that makes it possible to run npm install, for example Node JS https://nodejs.org/en/.

Thereafter, navigate to the map/file/place where you want the project to be stored . When these step is done, the project can be clone or downloaded. Run the following commands in the terminal window. 

Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/Juliafalk/KandJ3.git

Install the necessary package/extensions/APIs for the project
npm install

Start to simulate
react-native run-ios

Then, wait a couple of minutes for the simulator to starts, first time it can take around five minutes. 

When the simulator has started correctly, all is done and you are ready to explore the application, hope you enjoy it as much as we do!
